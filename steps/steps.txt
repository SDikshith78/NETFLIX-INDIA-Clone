Firstly,
we created this project using  "yarn" i.e, yarn create react-app netflix,
then we installed Tailwind CSS (used yarn since we did it in yarn like yarn add -D tailwind css) and then
Note:- We did few more steps in tailwind so check their official website for/of installation.

secondly,
we install some dependencies like axios for calling API's calls, react-router-dom and firebase
we did like: yarn add axios react-router-dom firebase. we also installed react-icons and tailwind-scrollbar-hide.
to use this plugin  in tailwind config file:  plugins: [require("tailwind-scrollbar-hide")],

Thirdly, check about "BrowserRouter" from react-router-dom, after that for Movies APi we got it from movies db i.e,
themoviedb.org - website login and get api (it is useful). check how he added api of popular, horror top rated etc.. in requests file.

used optional chaining(?.) in main.js  <img src="" alt={movie?.title} /> : check it
Timestamp:- API request end points

further more, check about 'slider' which discussed in row component.
now for firebase setup adn also we will use context API to manage our state to see user login or not.

Check video for firebase setup and authentication..

Note:- remember that after setting up firebase and copying the code of firebase SDk and keeping private API key in .env 
        we need to restart the server.

Check about firebase4 database and how to use it.
